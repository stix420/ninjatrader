Installation Instructions

With Ninjatrader CLOSED, drag and drop the Gexbot.dll and Newtonsoft.dll files into this directory:

\Documents\NinjaTrader 8\bin\Custom

Next, open Ninjatrader, open a new NT Editor. Right click the blank space, go to "References". Click on "Add" to add a reference, add ONLY the Newtonsoft.dll.

Now go to your chart, go to "Indicators" and Gexbot should show up in your list of indicators. (You won't find it in the NT Editor Indicator list).
